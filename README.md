## 👩🏻‍💻 My process
My journey into software development started with C and Java, followed by web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, despite my efforts, I struggled to land a job in those fields.

Determined to find the right path, I discovered Angela Yu's iOS course on Udemy, which sparked my interest. To deepen my knowledge, I also enrolled in an offline iOS development course. This combination of self-learning and structured training helped me break into the iOS industry, setting the foundation for my career.

Since then, I've been continuously growing, tackling real-world challenges, and refining my skills to build efficient and impactful iOS applications.
